# Spec List
If you need to reproduce an environment across computers with the same operating system, you can generate a spec list. For example, if you’re teaching a course and need to copy the environment for course exercises, the - -explicit option will produce a list of packages. To write the environment specifications to a file:

conda list --explicit > spec-list.txt

To recreate the environment:

conda create --name fallstudie --file spec-list.txt
